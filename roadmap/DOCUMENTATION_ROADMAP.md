# Orbit Framework Documentation Roadmap 2025-2026

## Overview

This roadmap outlines the documentation strategy for the Orbit Framework beyond the initial comprehensive documentation effort completed in May 2025. It focuses on aligning documentation with upcoming feature development, expanding multimedia resources, and increasing community engagement.

## Core Principles

1. **Documentation-First Development**
   - New features will be documented alongside code development
   - Documentation reviews become part of feature PR approval process
   - Documentation quality metrics integrated into release criteria

2. **Multi-Modal Learning**
   - Continued expansion of video content for advanced topics
   - Interactive examples for complex concepts
   - Diagram-first explanations for architectural components

3. **Community-Driven Expansion**
   - Templates and guides for community documentation contributions
   - Recognition system for documentation contributors
   - Quarterly documentation hackathons

## Upcoming Documentation Priorities (Q3-Q4 2025)

### 1. Next-Generation Rendering Features

As the framework expands its rendering capabilities, documentation will focus on:

- **WebGPU Advanced Features Guide**
  - Shader integration documentation
  - Custom rendering pipeline guides
  - Performance profiling and optimization

- **3D Rendering Documentation**
  - Scene graph management
  - Camera and lighting systems
  - Model loading and asset management

- **Animation System Documentation**
  - Animation primitives and concepts
  - Transition system reference
  - Physics-based animation

### 2. Mobile Platform Features

With the expansion to mobile platforms, documentation will cover:

- **Platform-Specific Guidelines**
  - iOS implementation details
  - Android implementation details
  - Cross-platform compatibility considerations

- **Mobile Performance Optimization**
