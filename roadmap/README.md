# 🗺️ Orbit Framework Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the development plan for the Orbit UI framework ecosystem, structured around key milestones that represent distinct phases of the project's evolution.

## 🌟 Vision

To create the most developer-friendly, performant, and cross-platform UI framework in the Rust ecosystem, enabling developers to build beautiful applications that work seamlessly across web, desktop, and embedded targets.

## 📋 Development Lifecycle Overview

The development of the Orbit Framework follows these main phases:

1. **Foundation Phase**: Establishing core architecture, rendering engines, and component model
2. **Developer Experience Phase**: Building tooling, documentation, and developer workflows
3. **Component Ecosystem Phase**: Creating a comprehensive library of components and design system
4. **Platform Expansion Phase**: Extending support to more platforms and improving compatibility
5. **Ecosystem Growth Phase**: Supporting third-party integrations and community contributions
6. **Enterprise Readiness Phase**: Adding features required for production use in enterprise environments

Each project component (orbit, orbiton, orbitkit, orlint) has its own timeline but is synchronized to deliver integrated value at each milestone.

> **Development Priority Note**: SDK-specific improvements are considered non-essential as they're primarily used for personal development purposes. The focus will remain on core framework development rather than SDK enhancements.

## 🚀 Current Status

The Orbit Framework is currently in **Week 1 of the MVP Sprint** for the **0.1.0 release**, part of the broader **Foundation Phase (Milestone 1)**.

### Current Sprint: 21-Day MVP Development (May 25 - June 14, 2025)

**Phase**: Week 1 - Foundation & Core Systems (Days 1-7)  
**Team Lead**: @itsalfredakku (Technical Lead & Core Architecture)  
**Target**: 0.1.0 MVP Release

#### Recent Achievements (Week 1)
- ✅ Component lifecycle enhancement in progress
- ✅ Props and events system implementation
- ✅ Unified rendering pipeline development
- ✅ CLI scaffolding and build system improvements
- ✅ Platform adapter enhancements

#### Upcoming Phases
- **Week 2 (Days 8-14)**: Feature Implementation & Integration
- **Week 3 (Days 15-21)**: Polish & Release Preparation
- **Post-MVP (Days 22-35)**: Consolidation & 0.1.1 patch
- **Milestone 1 Completion (Days 36-56)**: Animation, accessibility, styling
- **Milestone 2 Prep (Days 57-70)**: Developer experience planning
