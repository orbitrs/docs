# 🗺️ Orbit Framework Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the development plan for the Orbit UI framework ecosystem, structured around key milestones that represent distinct phases of the project's evolution.

## 🌟 Vision

To create the most developer-friendly, performant, and cross-platform UI framework in the Rust ecosystem, enabling developers to build beautiful applications that work seamlessly across web, desktop, and embedded targets.

## 📋 Development Lifecycle Overview

The development of the Orbit Framework follows these main phases:

1. **Foundation Phase**: Establishing core architecture, rendering engines, and component model
2. **Developer Experience Phase**: Building tooling, documentation, and developer workflows
3. **Component Ecosystem Phase**: Creating a comprehensive library of components and design system
4. **Platform Expansion Phase**: Extending support to more platforms and improving compatibility
5. **Ecosystem Growth Phase**: Supporting third-party integrations and community contributions
6. **Enterprise Readiness Phase**: Adding features required for production use in enterprise environments

Each project component (orbit, orbiton, orbitkit, orlint) has its own timeline but is synchronized to deliver integrated value at each milestone.

> **Development Priority Note**: SDK-specific improvements are considered non-essential as they're primarily used for personal development purposes. The focus will remain on core framework development rather than SDK enhancements.

## 🚀 Current Status

The Orbit Framework is currently in the **Foundation Phase**, focusing on the core architecture and initial developer experience.

### Recent Progress (May 2025)

- ✅ Fixed build target conflicts in examples project structure
- ✅ Implemented props system with validation in multiple examples
- ✅ Created component lifecycle demonstration examples
- ✅ Added WGPU renderer examples for 3D capabilities
- ✅ Improved project organization and documentation
