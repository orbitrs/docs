## 🚧 Blockers and Challenges

1. **Parser Performance**: Current implementation is too slow for large component trees
   - Action: @itsalfredakku investigating alternative parsing strategies
   - Target resolution: End of Q2 2025

2. **Skia Integration**: Challenges with text layout in non-Latin scripts
   - Action: @itsalfredakku researching font handling improvements
   - Target resolution: Mid Q2 2025

3. **WebAssembly Size**: Current WASM bundle is too large
   - Action: @itsalfredakku working on tree-shaking unused features
   - Target resolution: End of Q2 2025
