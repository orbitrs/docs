## 🚧 Blockers and Challenges

1. **Parser Performance**: Current implementation is too slow for large component trees
   - Action: @itsalfredakku investigating alternative parsing strategies
   - Target resolution: End of Q2 2025

2. **Skia Integration**: Challenges with text layout in non-Latin scripts
   - Action: @itsalfredakku researching font handling improvements
   - Target resolution: Mid Q2 2025

3. **WebAssembly Size**: Current WASM bundle is too large
   - Action: @itsalfredakku working on tree-shaking unused features
   - Target resolution: End of Q2 2025

## 🗓️ Upcoming Milestones

- **June 15, 2025**: Complete basic component parser
- **July 1, 2025**: Alpha release of rendering engine
- **August 15, 2025**: First end-to-end application example
- **September 30, 2025**: Target date for Milestone 1 completion

## 📋 Next Steps

1. Finalize component lifecycle implementation
2. Complete WASM target adapter integration
3. Improve error reporting in the CLI
4. Begin work on the layout engine

## 👥 How to Contribute

Current priority areas for contribution:

1. Unit tests for the component parser
2. Documentation for the `.orbit` file format
3. Performance improvements in the rendering pipeline
4. Cross-platform testing on various environments
