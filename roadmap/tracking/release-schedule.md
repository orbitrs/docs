# üìÖ Orbit Framework Release Schedule

**Last Updated**: May 20, 2025

This document outlines the planned release schedule for the Orbit Framework and its components. While we strive to adhere to this schedule, dates may shift based on development progress, quality considerations, and community feedback.

## üöÄ Release Strategy

The Orbit Framework follows a phased release approach:

1. **Pre-Alpha**: Early development builds for internal testing
2. **Alpha**: Developer preview with core functionality
3. **Beta**: Feature-complete builds for community testing
4. **Release Candidate (RC)**: Stabilization phase
5. **Stable Release**: Production-ready software
6. **Maintenance Updates**: Bug fixes and minor improvements

Each component (orbit, orbiton, orbitkit, orbit-analyzer) may have slightly different release timelines, but they are coordinated to provide a cohesive ecosystem.
