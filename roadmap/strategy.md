# üéØ Roadmap Execution Strategy

This document outlines the strategic approach for achieving the milestones defined in the Orbit Framework roadmap, detailing how resources will be allocated, progress tracked, and decisions made throughout the development process.

**Current Strategy Phase**: MVP Sprint Execution (May 25 - June 14, 2025)  
**Active Framework**: Agile development with 21-day sprint cycles  
**Team Lead**: @itsalfredakku (Technical Lead & Core Architecture)

## üöÄ Current Execution Mode: MVP Sprint Strategy

### Sprint-Based Development (Active)

Our current development approach utilizes intensive, focused sprints to deliver critical functionality:

**Current Sprint**: 21-Day MVP Development
- **Week 1 (Days 1-7)**: Foundation & Core Systems
- **Week 2 (Days 8-14)**: Feature Implementation & Integration  
- **Week 3 (Days 15-21)**: Polish & Release Preparation
- **Target**: 0.1.0 MVP Release

### Post-Sprint Strategy Phases

1. **Consolidation Phase** (Days 22-35) - Stabilization and community feedback
2. **Completion Phase** (Days 36-56) - Milestone 1 feature completion
3. **Preparation Phase** (Days 57-70) - Milestone 2 planning and setup
4. **Transition Phase** - Resume milestone-based development

## üìä Development Priority Framework

### Priority Categories

Our development efforts are categorized using the following priority framework:

1. **Foundation (P0)** - Critical components that other features depend on
2. **Core (P1)** - Essential features needed for basic functionality
3. **Enhancement (P2)** - Important improvements to existing functionality
4. **Growth (P3)** - Features that expand capabilities or reach
5. **Experimental (P4)** - Innovative features with uncertain value

### Decision Criteria

For each feature, we consider:

- **Impact**: How many users will benefit and to what degree
- **Effort**: Required development resources and complexity
- **Dependencies**: Prerequisites and blockers
- **Risk**: Potential for technical challenges or delays
- **Competitive Advantage**: Unique value compared to alternatives

## üß© Development Tracks

We organize development across parallel tracks to make consistent progress:

### Core Framework Track
- Component model
- Rendering engines
- State management
- Platform adapters

### Developer Tools Track
- CLI tools
- Documentation
- Editor integrations
- Analysis tools

### Component Library Track
- Core UI components
- Theming system
- Layout system
- Advanced components

### Community & Ecosystem Track
- Example applications
- Tutorials and guides
- Community infrastructure
- External integrations

## ‚è±Ô∏è Release Cadence

### Versioning Strategy

We follow semantic versioning (SemVer) with:

- **Major releases** (x.0.0): Breaking changes, significant new capabilities
- **Minor releases** (0.x.0): New features, non-breaking enhancements
- **Patch releases** (0.0.x): Bug fixes and minor improvements

### Release Schedule

- **Major releases**: Approximately every 12-18 months
- **Minor releases**: Every 2-3 months
- **Patch releases**: As needed, typically every 2-4 weeks

### Preview Releases

- **Alpha versions**: Early access to new features, expect breaking changes
- **Beta versions**: Feature complete for testing, API stabilizing
- **Release candidates**: Final testing before stable release

## üîÑ Development Process

### Feature Lifecycle

1. **Proposal**: Feature is proposed and discussed
2. **Design**: Technical specifications and approach determined
3. **Development**: Implementation and testing
4. **Review**: Code review, performance assessment, documentation
5. **Release**: Inclusion in a release version
6. **Feedback**: Community feedback collection and analysis

### Progress Tracking

- **GitHub Projects**: Track feature development status
- **Milestone tracking**: Regular updates on milestone progress
- **Public roadmap**: Updated quarterly with current priorities
- **Release notes**: Detailed changelog for each release

## üß™ Quality Assurance

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit tests**: 80%+ coverage of core functionality
- **Integration tests**: Cross-component interaction verification
- **End-to-end tests**: Complete application workflows
- **Performance benchmarks**: Track and maintain performance metrics
- **Compatibility testing**: Ensure cross-platform functionality

### Continuous Integration

- Automated testing on every pull request
- Regular performance benchmarking
- Compatibility verification across supported platforms
- Documentation build and verification

## üõ†Ô∏è Resource Allocation

### Current Team Focus (2025)

- 40% Core framework development
- 25% Developer tools and experience
- 20% Documentation and examples
- 15% Community support and growth

### Community Contribution

Areas where community contributions are especially valuable:
- Component library expansion
- Example applications
- Documentation improvements
- Platform-specific optimizations
- Testing and bug reports

## üö® Risk Management

### Known Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|------------|--------|---------------------|
| WGPU API changes | Medium | High | Modular abstraction layer, regular dependency updates |
| Cross-platform inconsistencies | High | Medium | Clear platform capability documentation, progressive enhancement |
| Performance regression | Medium | High | Automated benchmarks, performance budgets |
| API design limitations | Medium | High | Early feedback cycles, experimental feature flags |
| Documentation debt | High | Medium | Documentation-driven development, dedicated doc sprints |

### Contingency Planning

1. **Technical Debt**: Dedicated sprints for technical debt reduction
2. **Priority Shifts**: Quarterly roadmap reviews with community input
3. **Resource Constraints**: Clear prioritization framework for scaling back if needed
4. **Adoption Challenges**: UX research to identify friction points

## üì¢ Communication Strategy

### Progress Communication

- Monthly development updates
- Quarterly roadmap reviews
- Release announcements with complete changelogs
- Transparent discussion of challenges and changes

### Feedback Channels

- GitHub Discussions for feature requests and questions
- Regular community surveys on priorities
- User testing sessions for major features
- Direct engagement with early adopters

## üîí Governance

### Decision Making

- **Technical decisions**: RFC process with public discussion
- **Roadmap priorities**: Maintainer team with community input
- **API design**: Design reviews with domain experts
- **Breaking changes**: Conservative approach with migration paths

### Contribution Process

- Clear contribution guidelines
- Mentoring for new contributors
- Recognition for significant contributions
- Path to maintainership for consistent contributors
