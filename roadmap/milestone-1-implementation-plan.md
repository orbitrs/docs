# Milestone 1: Implementation Plan

**Status**: 🟡 In Progress  
**Target Completion**: Q3 2025  
**Last Updated**: May 23, 2025

## Overview

This document outlines the detailed implementation plan for completing Milestone 1 of the Orbit Framework. The focus is on finishing the core architecture, rendering engines, and component model to provide a solid foundation for future development.

## Critical Path Items

Below are the remaining critical path items for Milestone 1, prioritized by implementation order:

### 1. Component Lifecycle Management

**Priority**: Highest  
**Owner**: Core Team  
**Status**: ✅ Completed  
**Estimated Timeline**: 4-6 weeks  

#### Technical Requirements:

1. **Component Creation and Mounting** ✅
   - Define clear stages: initialization, construction, mounting
   - Implement parent-child relationship tracking
   - Create DOM/virtual DOM attachment process for web targets

2. **Update and Re-render Mechanism** ✅
   - Design change detection system (dirty checking or reactive)
   - Implement efficient partial re-rendering
   - Create update queue with priority handling

3. **Unmounting and Cleanup** ✅
   - Resource disposal (event listeners, timers, etc.)
   - Memory management for large resources
   - Cache invalidation

4. **Lifecycle Hooks API** ✅
   - `onMount` - Called when component is mounted to the DOM/renderer
   - `onUpdate` - Called when props or state change
   - `onBeforeUpdate` - Called before updating the DOM/renderer
   - `onUnmount` - Called when component is removed

### 2. State Management System

**Priority**: High  
**Owner**: Core Team  
**Status**: ✅ Completed  
**Estimated Timeline**: 4-6 weeks  

#### Technical Requirements:

1. **Reactive State Tracking** ✅
   - Fine-grained reactivity system
   - Change detection mechanisms
   - State mutation API

2. **State Update Batching** ✅
   - Group related state changes
   - Optimize rendering updates
   - Prioritize critical state changes

3. **Derived State Mechanism** ✅
   - Computed properties based on state
   - Caching of derived values
   - Dependency tracking

4. **State Persistence** ✅
   - Serialization/deserialization
   - Local storage integration
   - State hydration from server

### 3. Props and Event Handling

**Priority**: High  
**Owner**: Core Team  
**Status**: ✅ Completed  
**Estimated Timeline**: 4-6 weeks  

#### Technical Requirements:

1. **Type-safe Props System** ✅
   - Compile-time type checking
   - Default values
   - Required vs optional props
   - Prop validation

2. **Event Delegation System** ✅
   - Native event wrapping
   - Custom event types
   - Event bubbling and capturing
   - Event handler registration

3. **Parent-child Communication** ✅
   - Callback props
   - Event propagation
   - Context passing

### 4. WGPU Rendering Capabilities

**Priority**: Medium-High  
**Owner**: Core Team  
**Status**: ✅ Completed  
**Estimated Timeline**: 8-10 weeks  

#### Technical Requirements:

1. **WGPU Integration** ✅
   - Core WGPU setup and pipeline
   - Surface management
   - Device and queue handling
   - Swapchain configuration

2. **Shader System** ✅
   - Shader compilation pipeline
   - Built-in shaders for common use cases
   - Custom shader support
   - Shader hot reloading

3. **3D Model Rendering** ✅
   - Mesh loading and processing
   - Material system
   - Camera and transform management
   - Basic lighting system

4. **Renderer Selection and Composition** ✅
   - Automatic renderer selection
   - Renderer composition for hybrid UIs
   - Performance-based switching

---

## Dependencies and Prerequisites

1. Understanding of current codebase architecture ✅
2. Skia renderer implementation (already in progress) ✅
3. Parser and component model foundations (already in place) ✅
4. Familiarity with WGPU API and concepts ✅

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| WGPU API changes | High | Medium | Version pinning, abstraction layer |
| Performance issues | High | Medium | Early benchmarking, incremental approach |
| Cross-platform compatibility | High | Medium | Comprehensive testing matrix |
| Integration complexity | Medium | High | Modular approach, clear interfaces |

## Success Criteria

1. All critical path items implemented and tested ✅
2. Performance benchmarks meeting or exceeding targets ⏳
3. Comprehensive test coverage (>80%) ⏳
4. Documentation for all new APIs and features ✅
5. Sample applications demonstrating all features ✅
