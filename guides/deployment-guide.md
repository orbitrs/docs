# Deployment Guide for Orbit Applications

This guide provides comprehensive instructions for deploying your Orbit applications to various environments, from simple static hosting to complex cloud infrastructure.

## Overview

Deploying an Orbit application involves:

1. Building for production
2. Optimizing assets
3. Configuring the deployment environment
4. Deploying to your chosen platform
5. Setting up monitoring and maintenance

## Production Build

Before deploying, create a production-optimized build of your application:

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd my-orbit-app

# Create a production build
orbiton build --release
```

The `--release` flag ensures Rust compilation optimizations are enabled, resulting in smaller, faster builds.

### Build Options

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--release` | Enables Rust optimizations for production builds |
| `--minify` | Minifies CSS and JavaScript assets |
| `--target <target>` | Specifies the build target (web, desktop, native) |
| `--renderer <renderer>` | Specifies which renderer to use (skia, wgpu, hybrid) |

### Build Output

The build process generates output in the `dist/` directory:

```
dist/
├── index.html           # Entry point HTML file
├── assets/              # Optimized assets
│   ├── js/              # Compiled JavaScript
│   ├── css/             # Compiled CSS
│   └── images/          # Optimized images
├── wasm/                # WebAssembly modules (for web targets)
└── _app/                # Application metadata
```

## Deployment Options

### Static Hosting (Web Applications)

For web-based Orbit applications, you can deploy to any static hosting service:

#### Netlify

1. Install the Netlify CLI:
   ```bash
   npm install -g netlify-cli
   ```

2. Login to your Netlify account:
   ```bash
   netlify login
   ```

3. Deploy your application:
   ```bash
   netlify deploy --dir=dist --prod
   ```

#### Vercel

1. Install the Vercel CLI:
   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   ```

2. Login to your Vercel account:
   ```bash
   vercel login
   ```

3. Deploy your application:
   ```bash
   vercel --prod
   ```

#### GitHub Pages

1. Create a `deploy.yml` GitHub Actions workflow file in `.github/workflows/`:

```yaml
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - name: Install Rust toolchain
        uses: actions-rs/toolchain@v1
        with:
          toolchain: stable
          profile: minimal
          
      - name: Install Orbiton CLI
        run: cargo install orbiton
          
      - name: Build
        run: orbiton build --release
        
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        uses: JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action@4.1.5
        with:
          branch: gh-pages
          folder: dist
```

### Docker Containerization

For more complex deployments or microservices architectures:

1. Create a `Dockerfile` in your project root:

```dockerfile
# Base image with Rust installed
FROM rust:1.70-slim as builder

# Install dependencies
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    pkg-config \
    libssl-dev \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Install Orbiton CLI
RUN cargo install orbiton

# Create a new empty project
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .

# Build the application
RUN orbiton build --release

# Runtime image
FROM nginx:alpine
COPY --from=builder /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html
EXPOSE 80
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

2. Build and run the Docker container:

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t my-orbit-app .

# Run the container
docker run -p 8080:80 my-orbit-app
```

### Cloud Platform Deployment

#### AWS Amplify

1. Set up an Amplify project:
   ```bash
   npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli
   amplify init
   ```

2. Add hosting:
   ```bash
   amplify add hosting
   ```

3. Deploy:
   ```bash
   amplify publish
   ```

#### Google Cloud Run

1. Install Google Cloud SDK and authenticate:
   ```bash
   gcloud auth login
   ```

2. Build and deploy with Cloud Build:
   ```bash
   gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/orbit-app
   gcloud run deploy orbit-app --image gcr.io/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/orbit-app --platform managed
   ```

### Desktop Application Distribution

For Orbit applications targeting desktop platforms:

#### Windows

1. Create an installer using NSIS or WiX Toolset:
   ```bash
   orbiton build --release --target windows
   # Package using a tool like cargo-wix
   cargo install cargo-wix
   cargo wix --nocapture
   ```

#### macOS

1. Create a `.app` bundle and DMG:
   ```bash
   orbiton build --release --target macos
   # Package using a tool like cargo-bundle
   cargo install cargo-bundle
   cargo bundle --release
   ```

#### Linux

1. Create packages for different distributions:
   ```bash
   orbiton build --release --target linux
   # Package using cargo-deb for Debian-based distributions
   cargo install cargo-deb
   cargo deb
   ```

## Configuration Management

### Environment Variables

Use environment variables for configuration that varies between environments:

```rust
use std::env;

fn main() {
    let api_url = env::var("API_URL").unwrap_or_else(|_| {
        "https://default-api.example.com".to_string()
    });
    
    // Use the configuration
}
```

For web applications, you can use `.env` files to manage environment variables locally and configure them in your deployment platform for production.

### Feature Flags

Use Rust's feature flags to conditionally enable certain features:

```toml
# Cargo.toml
[dependencies]
some_package = { version = "1.0", features = ["feature1", "feature2"] }

[features]
production = ["some_package/optimization"]
staging = ["some_package/logging"]
```

## Performance Optimization

### Lazy Loading

For web applications, implement lazy loading for components that aren't immediately needed:

```rust
use orbit::lazy_component;

lazy_component!(LargeComponent);

fn main() {
    // LargeComponent will be loaded only when needed
}
```

### Asset Optimization

Optimize images and other assets:

```bash
# Install image optimization tools
npm install -g svgo imagemin-cli

# Optimize SVG files
svgo -f src/assets/svg -o dist/assets/svg

# Optimize other image formats
imagemin src/assets/images/* --out-dir=dist/assets/images
```

## Monitoring and Analytics

### Application Monitoring

Integrate with monitoring services like New Relic, Datadog, or Sentry:

```rust
use orbit::monitoring::Sentry;

fn main() {
    Sentry::init("https://your-sentry-dsn.ingest.sentry.io/project");
    
    // Rest of your application
}
```

### Analytics

Add analytics to track user behavior:

```rust
use orbit::analytics::GoogleAnalytics;

fn main() {
    GoogleAnalytics::init("UA-XXXXX-Y");
    
    // Rest of your application
}
```

## Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)

Set up automated workflows to build, test, and deploy your application whenever code changes are pushed.

### GitHub Actions Example

```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

env:
  CARGO_TERM_COLOR: always

      - name: Build for web
        run: orbiton build --target web --release
      - name: Upload web artifacts
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: web-artifacts
          path: dist/

  deploy:
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    needs: [build-desktop, build-web]
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Download web artifacts
        uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: web-artifacts
          path: dist-web/
      - name: Download desktop artifacts
        uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: desktop-artifacts
          path: dist-desktop/
      - name: Deploy to production
        # Use your preferred deployment method here
        run: echo "Deploying to production..."
```

## Security Considerations

### Web Security Headers

For web applications, configure the following security headers:

- Content-Security-Policy
- X-XSS-Protection
- X-Content-Type-Options
- X-Frame-Options
- Strict-Transport-Security

### HTTPS Configuration

Always serve your web applications over HTTPS. Most deployment platforms handle this automatically, but if you're using a custom server:

```nginx
# Nginx example
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name example.com;

    ssl_certificate /path/to/certificate.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /path/to/private.key;
    
    # Modern SSL configuration
    ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
    ssl_prefer_server_ciphers off;
    
    location / {
        root /var/www/html;
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
    }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Deployment Issues

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Missing dependencies on server | Ensure your Dockerfile or build script installs all required dependencies |
| Routing issues in SPA | Configure server to redirect all requests to index.html |
| Environment variable not set | Verify environment configuration in your deployment platform |
| CORS issues | Configure proper CORS headers for your API endpoints |
| WebAssembly not loading | Ensure proper MIME types are set for .wasm files |

### Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Run tests locally before deploying
- [ ] Create a production build
- [ ] Check for any hardcoded development URLs or settings
- [ ] Verify all assets are properly bundled
- [ ] Test the production build locally before deployment
- [ ] Configure environment variables in the deployment platform
