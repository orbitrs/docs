# Orbit Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server

**Date**: May 25, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Authors**: Orbit Framework Team

## Overview

The Orbit Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server is a specialized server that exposes the Orbit Framework's functionality to AI agents, particularly code assistants like GitHub Copilot. The MCP server provides a standardized interface through which AI agents can interact with Orbit projects for tasks such as creating components, modifying code, running tests, accessing documentation, and debugging issues.

## Motivation

As AI-assisted development becomes increasingly prominent, there's a need to provide AI agents with structured, programmatic access to framework capabilities. The MCP server addresses this need by offering a standardized API that enables AI agents to:

- Understand the structure of Orbit projects
- Create and modify components with knowledge of the framework's patterns
- Access documentation and examples contextually
- Run builds and tests to validate changes
- Receive real-time feedback about project state

## Architecture

The MCP server is designed as a standalone application that runs alongside the Orbit development server. It provides both HTTP and WebSocket interfaces:

                                 ▼
                         ┌───────────────────┐
                         │                   │
                         │  Orbit Framework  │
                         │                   │
                         └───────────────────┘
```

### Key Components

1. **HTTP API**: RESTful endpoints for basic operations and information retrieval
2. **WebSocket API**: JSON-RPC protocol for real-time interactions and events
3. **Project Analysis**: Tools for understanding project structure and component relationships
4. **Code Generation**: Utilities for generating and modifying Orbit components with proper patterns
5. **Documentation Access**: Contextual documentation retrieval system

## API Overview

The MCP server exposes the following primary API categories:

### Component Management

APIs for working with Orbit components:

- Creating components from templates or specifications
- Modifying existing components
- Analyzing component structure and relationships

### Project Management

APIs for working with Orbit projects:

- Creating new projects with specified templates
- Managing project structure and dependencies
- Analyzing project health and architecture

### Build and Compilation

APIs for building Orbit projects:

- Running builds with specific targets and configurations
- Retrieving build errors and warnings
- Optimizing build performance

### Testing

APIs for testing Orbit applications:

- Running tests with configurable options
- Retrieving test results and code coverage
- Generating test cases

### Documentation Access

APIs for accessing Orbit documentation:

- Querying documentation based on context
- Retrieving examples relevant to current tasks
- Accessing best practices and guides

## Integration Use Cases

### GitHub Copilot Integration

GitHub Copilot can connect to the MCP server to:

1. Understand the structure of an Orbit project
2. Generate components that follow Orbit patterns and conventions
3. Fix build errors by understanding the specific error context
4. Recommend optimizations based on project analysis
5. Suggest tests based on component specifications

### VS Code Extension Integration

The Orbit VS Code extension can use the MCP server to:

1. Provide AI-powered code completions specific to Orbit
2. Offer intelligent refactoring suggestions
3. Automate common tasks with AI assistance
4. Provide contextual documentation and examples

## Security Considerations

The MCP server is designed primarily for local development environments. When used in production or shared environments, consider:

1. **Authentication**: Enable authentication for server access
2. **Authorization**: Restrict actions based on user roles
3. **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse through rate limiting
4. **Sandbox Environments**: Isolate execution environments for safety

## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
# Install the MCP server
cargo install orbit-mcp

# Or build from source
git clone https://github.com/orbitrs/orbit.git
cd orbit/sdk
cargo build --release -p orbit-mcp
```

### Usage

```bash
# Start the MCP server
orbit-mcp --port 3000

# Connect to the WebSocket API
ws://localhost:3000/api/ws

# Access the HTTP API
http://localhost:3000/api/status
```

## Future Directions

- Integration with more AI platforms beyond GitHub Copilot
- Enhanced code generation with more context-awareness
- Improved documentation retrieval with semantic search
- Support for collaborative AI-assisted development
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines for AI-assisted quality checks
