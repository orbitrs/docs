# Beta Toolchain Compatibility Monitoring

**Date**: May 25, 2025  
**Status**: Active Monitoring  
**Purpose**: Early detection of compatibility issues with upcoming Rust releases

## Overview

The Orbit Framework includes automated monitoring of compatibility with Rust beta toolchain releases. This monitoring provides early warning of potential issues without blocking development on stable toolchain releases.

## Current Status

As of May 25, 2025, beta compatibility monitoring is active and reporting package-specific failures:

### Ubuntu & macOS Platforms
- **orbiton tests**: Failed ❌
- **orbit clippy**: Failed ❌  
- **orbiton clippy**: Failed ❌
- **examples clippy**: Failed ❌
- **orlint tests**: Passed ✅
- **orbit tests**: Passed ✅

## Monitoring Approach

### Non-blocking Development
- Beta compatibility failures are marked as **non-blocking**
- Core development continues on stable Rust toolchain
- Issues are tracked for proactive resolution

### Package-level Tracking
The CI system monitors compatibility across all framework components:
- **orbit**: Core framework
- **orbiton**: CLI tooling
- **orlint**: Static analyzer
- **examples**: Sample applications

### Automated Reporting
- GitHub Actions provide detailed failure analysis
- Step summaries show package-specific status
- Failure details collected for investigation

## Integration with Development Process

### Current MVP Sprint (May 25 - June 14, 2025)
During the 21-day MVP sprint, beta compatibility monitoring continues in the background while the team focuses on:
- Component lifecycle enhancement
- Props and events system
- State management integration
- Rendering pipeline coordination

### Future Milestone Integration
Beta compatibility issues will be addressed as part of:
- **Milestone 2**: Developer Experience improvements
- **Milestone 4**: Platform expansion and compatibility
- **Milestone 6**: Enterprise readiness and stability

## Resolution Strategy

### Immediate Actions
1. **Monitor trends**: Track which packages consistently fail
2. **Categorize failures**: Distinguish between breaking changes and warnings
3. **Document patterns**: Identify common failure causes

### Long-term Planning
1. **Proactive fixes**: Address compatibility issues during regular development
2. **API stability**: Design APIs to be resilient to Rust language evolution
3. **Testing enhancement**: Expand compatibility testing as needed

## Risk Assessment

- **Likelihood**: Medium (beta toolchain changes are expected)
- **Impact**: Low (non-blocking, advance warning system)
- **Mitigation**: Automated monitoring, proactive issue tracking
