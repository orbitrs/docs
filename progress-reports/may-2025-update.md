# May 2025 Progress Report: OrbitRS SDK

## Executive Summary

In May 2025, the OrbitRS SDK team made significant progress on Milestone 1 (Foundation) by fixing build issues, implementing example applications demonstrating core framework features, and improving project organization. This has advanced our progress in component model implementation, rendering engines, and platform adapters.

## Key Accomplishments

### Project Organization
- Fixed build target conflicts in examples project
- Reorganized the examples structure to prevent files from being in multiple build targets
- Established consistent project architecture with better library structure

### Component Model
- Implemented props system with validation in multiple examples
- Demonstrated component lifecycle features in dedicated example
- Created state management examples showing reactive patterns

### Rendering Engines
- Enhanced Skia-based 2D rendering examples 
- Added WGPU renderer example demonstrating 3D capabilities
- Established foundation for unified rendering pipeline

### Platform Adapters
- Improved desktop adapters for window system integration
- Enhanced event handling for mouse and keyboard input

## Technical Details

### Build System Improvements
- Modified Cargo.toml to properly organize example binaries
- Created library definition for better project structure
- Eliminated warnings related to files being in multiple build targets

### Example Applications
- `props_minimal.rs` - Shows basic props system usage
- `props_example.rs` - Demonstrates advanced props with validation
- `props_and_events.rs` - Implements comprehensive event handling
- `component_lifecycle.rs` - Shows complete component lifecycle
- `advanced_skia.rs` - Demonstrates custom Skia rendering
- `wgpu_renderer.rs` - Implements WGPU-based 3D rendering
- `skia_test.rs` and `window_test.rs` - Tests for core platform features

## Next Steps

For the remainder of Q2 2025, the team will focus on:

1. Expanding the component model with advanced state management features
2. Enhancing the rendering pipeline with layout engine integration
3. Implementing cross-platform testing infrastructure
4. Improving developer tooling for faster iteration

## Milestone Progress

Milestone 1 (Foundation) is now approximately 30% complete, with significant progress in key areas:
- Component Model: 40% complete
- Rendering Engines: 30% complete
- Platform Adapters: 25% complete
- Core APIs: 15% complete
