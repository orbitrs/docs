# Orbit Framework Development Priorities

*Last Updated: May 23, 2025*

## Priority Focus

The Orbit Framework team has established the following priority focus areas for development. These priorities have been updated to reflect the decision to focus on core framework development rather than SDK improvements, which are considered non-essential as they are primarily used for personal development purposes.

## High Priority (Must Complete)

### Component Model Completion
- Component lifecycle management implementation
- State management system
- Props and event handling system

### Rendering Pipeline
- Unified rendering pipeline
- Layout engine with flexbox support
- Common renderer interface

### Core APIs
- Event handling system
- Styling system
- Accessibility support foundations

## Medium Priority (Should Complete)

### Platform Support
- Mobile platform adapters (iOS, Android)
- Touch input handling
- Mobile viewport management

### Advanced Rendering
- WGPU-based 3D rendering capabilities
- 3D model rendering
- Material system basics

### Developer Experience Foundations
- Improved error handling and reporting
- Basic hot module replacement
- Development server enhancements

## Low Priority (Can Defer)

### SDK Improvements
- SDK-specific tooling enhancements
- Documentation generation tools
- SDK build optimizations

### Extended Feature Set
- Animation system
- Advanced state persistence
- Specialized component variants

## Non-Essential (Personal Development)

### SDK Enhancements
- All SDK improvements not directly related to core framework functionality
- SDK utilities and helpers
- SDK-specific documentation

## Implementation Focus

When implementing features, focus on:

1. **Core Functionality First**: Ensure basic functionality works before adding advanced features
2. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Features should work consistently across all target platforms
3. **Developer Experience**: Make APIs intuitive and self-documenting
4. **Performance**: Optimize for both runtime performance and build-time efficiency
5. **Testing**: Ensure comprehensive test coverage for new features

## Review Process

These priorities will be reviewed quarterly and updated based on:
- Progress toward milestone completion
- Feedback from early adopters
- Changing requirements or opportunities

## Important Note

The primary goal remains completing Milestone 1 (Foundation Phase) by Q3 2025, with a focus on delivering a solid foundation for the core framework rather than SDK enhancements. Resources should be allocated accordingly.
