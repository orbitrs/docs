# Orbit Framework Development Priorities

*Last Updated: May 24, 2025*

## Priority Focus & Rapid Development Strategy

The Orbit Framework team has established the following priority focus areas for development with an accelerated 3-week timeline toward 0.1.0 release. These priorities focus on core framework development rather than SDK improvements, with emphasis on rapid iteration and continuous delivery.

### Rapid Development Acceleration (21-Day Sprint)

**Week 1: Foundation & Optimization**
- Days 1-2: Environment setup, build optimization, CI/CD pipeline
- Days 3-7: Core component model completion, rendering pipeline optimization

**Week 2: Feature Implementation**
- Days 8-14: Developer experience enhancement, orbiton CLI improvements
- Advanced rendering features, state management system completion

**Week 3: Integration & Release**
- Days 15-21: Cross-platform testing, documentation finalization, 0.1.0 release preparation

### Daily Development Velocity Targets
- **2-3 commits per day** with meaningful progress
- **Feature completion within 2-3 days** maximum
- **Immediate testing** with every feature implementation
- **Documentation updates** concurrent with code changes

## Recent Progress

Significant progress has been made in several key areas:

- **Examples project structure** has been refactored to fix build target conflicts
- **Props system** implementation is now demonstrated in multiple examples
- **Component lifecycle** features have been implemented and documented
- **Rendering engines** now include both Skia and WGPU examples
- **Code quality improvements** with compiler warnings and Clippy lints fixed
- **Component implementation refinements** with improved handling of unused fields

## High Priority (Must Complete - Week 1 & 2)

### Core Component Model Completion
- Component lifecycle management implementation
- State management system with reactive updates
- Props validation and event handling system
- Context API for component communication

### Rendering Pipeline Optimization
- Unified rendering pipeline
- Layout engine with flexbox support
- Common renderer interface
- Performance optimization for Skia and WGPU renderers

### Core APIs & Developer Experience
- Event handling system with delegation
- Styling system with CSS-like syntax
- Accessibility support foundations
- Hot reload and development server enhancements

## Medium Priority (Should Complete - Week 2 & 3)

### Platform Support & Cross-Platform Features
- Mobile platform adapters (iOS, Android)
- Touch input handling
- Mobile viewport management
- Cross-platform testing automation

### Advanced Rendering & Animation
- WGPU-based 3D rendering capabilities
- Basic animation support
- Material system basics
- Performance benchmarking suite

### Orbiton CLI Enhancements
- Watch mode for development
- Project scaffolding templates
- Build optimization tools
- Error reporting improvements

## Low Priority (Can Defer)

### SDK Improvements
- SDK-specific tooling enhancements
- Documentation generation tools
- SDK build optimizations

### Extended Feature Set
- Animation system
- Advanced state persistence
- Specialized component variants

## Non-Essential (Personal Development)

### SDK Enhancements
- All SDK improvements not directly related to core framework functionality
- SDK utilities and helpers
- SDK-specific documentation

## Implementation Focus & Rapid Development Methodology

### Daily Development Practices
1. **Morning Planning**: Start each day with clear objectives and deliverables
2. **Incremental Development**: Break features into 2-4 hour implementation chunks
3. **Immediate Testing**: Test every feature as it's implemented
4. **Documentation-First**: Update docs concurrent with code changes
5. **Evening Review**: Commit progress and plan next day's priorities

### Development Velocity Targets
- **2-3 meaningful commits per day** with substantive progress
- **Feature completion within 2-3 days** maximum per feature
- **Zero-delay integration** - no features sit waiting for integration
- **Continuous deployment** to staging environments

### Technical Focus Areas
1. **Core Functionality First**: Ensure basic functionality works before adding advanced features
2. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Features should work consistently across all target platforms
3. **Developer Experience**: Make APIs intuitive and self-documenting
4. **Performance**: Optimize for both runtime performance and build-time efficiency
5. **Testing**: Ensure comprehensive test coverage for new features

### Build System Optimization
- Incremental compilation optimizations
- Parallel build processes
- Fast development rebuild cycles
- Automated dependency management

## Progress Tracking & Review Process

### Weekly Milestone Checkpoints
- **Week 1**: Core foundation and build optimization complete
- **Week 2**: Essential features implemented and tested
- **Week 3**: Integration testing and 0.1.0 release preparation

### Daily Progress Metrics
- Commit frequency and quality
- Feature completion rate
- Test coverage improvements
- Documentation completeness

### Review Schedule
- **Daily**: Progress review and next-day planning
- **Weekly**: Milestone assessment and priority adjustment
- **End of Sprint**: Comprehensive review and release readiness assessment

### Success Criteria for 0.1.0 Release
- All high-priority features implemented and tested
- Cross-platform compatibility verified
- Documentation complete and accurate
- Performance benchmarks meet targets
- Developer experience validated through testing

## Important Note

The primary goal remains completing a robust 0.1.0 release within the 21-day rapid development sprint, with a focus on delivering a solid foundation for the core framework rather than SDK enhancements. Resources should be allocated accordingly, with daily progress tracking to ensure velocity targets are met.
