# Task Manager Tutorial Video Guide

This document provides a comprehensive video walkthrough of the [Task Manager Tutorial](./tutorial-task-manager.md), with timestamped links to specific sections, interactive code examples, and implementation guidance.

## Introduction to the Video Series

The Task Manager Tutorial video series offers a complete, step-by-step guide to building a fully functional task management application using the Orbit UI Framework. These videos complement the written tutorial by showing real-time coding, explaining design decisions, and demonstrating how components interact in a production-quality application.

## Series Overview

The complete series consists of five episodes that guide you through every aspect of building the Task Manager application:

1. **Getting Started with Orbit** - Environment setup and project creation (15:24)
2. **Building the Task Component** - Core components and UI structure (18:36)
3. **State Management and Interactions** - App state and user interactions (22:15)
4. **Filters and Storage** - Filtering tasks and local storage integration (20:42)
5. **Polishing and Deployment** - Final touches and production build (17:51)

Total runtime: 1 hour 34 minutes

**Interactive Code Snippets:**
```rust
// src/components/app.orbit
<template>
  <div class="app">
    <h1>Task Manager</h1>
    <p>Welcome to your task management application!</p>
  </div>
</template>

<style>
.app {
  max-width: 800px;
  margin: 0 auto;
  padding: 2rem;
  font-family: system-ui, -apple-system, sans-serif;
}

h1 {
  color: #2c3e50;
  text-align: center;
}
</style>

<code lang="rust">
use orbit::prelude::*;

pub struct App;

impl Component for App {
    type Props = ();
    
    fn new(_: Self::Props) -> Self {
        Self
    }
}
</code>
```

### Episode 2: Building the Task Component (18:36)
