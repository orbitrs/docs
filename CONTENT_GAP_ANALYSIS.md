# Orbit Framework Documentation Content Gap Analysis

## 1. Introduction and Purpose

This document outlines the process and findings of a content gap analysis for the Orbit UI Framework documentation. The purpose is to identify missing, outdated, or incomplete documentation sections to ensure comprehensive and up-to-date resources for users and contributors. This aligns with Phase 1 of the Documentation Improvement Plan.

## 2. Methodology

The gap analysis will be conducted by:

1.  **Reviewing Existing Documentation**: Systematically going through all current documentation outlined in `DOCUMENTATION_PLAN.md`.
2.  **Comparing with Framework Features**: Cross-referencing documentation with the actual features, components, and capabilities of the Orbit framework, OrbitKit, and Orbiton CLI.
3.  **Analyzing User Needs**: Considering common questions, pain points, and areas where users (developers, designers) would require guidance (e.g., from GitHub issues, community discussions if available).
4.  **Benchmarking (Optional)**: Comparing with documentation of similar UI frameworks for best practices and common topics.

## 3. Core Framework Features (`.orbit` files, runtime, reactivity)

Based on `orbit/orbit-spec.md` and general framework expectations.
