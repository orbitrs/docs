# Introduction and Purpose

## Framework Documentation Content Gap Analysis

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the process and findings of a content gap analysis for the Orbit UI Framework documentation. The purpose is to identify missing, outdated, or incomplete documentation sections to ensure comprehensive and up-to-date resources for users and contributors. This aligns with Phase 1 of the Documentation Improvement Plan.

| Documentation Item          | Current Status                             | Gap/Notes                                                          | Priority  | Status      |
| :-------------------------- | :----------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------- | :---------- |
| Getting Started             | `docs/getting-started/getting-started.md` (detailed) | Comprehensive setup guide with extensive troubleshooting sections, platform-specific guidance, development environment setup, and community resources | High     | ✅ Completed |
| Tutorial: Task Manager      | `docs/getting-started/tutorial-task-manager.md` (comprehensive) | Excellent detailed tutorial, would benefit from video accompaniment | Medium   | 🔄 Pending |
| Deployment Guide            | `docs/guides/deployment-guide.md` (comprehensive) | Comprehensive guide covering all deployment scenarios and platforms | High     | ✅ Completed |
| State Management In-Depth   | `docs/core-concepts/state-management.md` (detailed) | Good coverage but needs more complex examples for large applications | Medium   | ✅ Completed |
| Creating Reusable Components| `docs/core-concepts/advanced-component-patterns.md` | Existing but could be expanded with more design patterns  | Medium   | ✅ Completed |

## 2. Methodology

The gap analysis will be conducted by:

1.  **Reviewing Existing Documentation**: Systematically going through all current documentation outlined in `DOCUMENTATION_PLAN.md`.
2.  **Comparing with Framework Features**: Cross-referencing documentation with the actual features, components, and capabilities of the Orbit framework, component library, and Orbiton CLI.
3.  **Analyzing User Needs**: Considering common questions, pain points, and areas where users (developers, designers) would require guidance (e.g., from GitHub issues, community discussions if available).
4.  **Benchmarking (Optional)**: Comparing with documentation of similar UI frameworks for best practices and common topics.

## 3. Core Framework Features (`.orbit` files, runtime, reactivity)

Based on `orbit/orbit-spec.md` and general framework expectations.
