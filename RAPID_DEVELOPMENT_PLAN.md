## Development Velocity Targets

| Week | Feature Completion | Documentation | Testing Coverage |
|------|-------------------|---------------|------------------|
| 1    | 90%              | 100%          | 75%              |
| 2    | 95%              | 100%          | 85%              |
| 3    | 100%             | 100%          | 95%              |

## Resource Allocation for Rapid Development

### Development Team Focus
- **60%** Core framework implementation
- **25%** Tooling and developer experience
- **10%** Testing and quality assurance
- **5%** Documentation updates

### Daily Development Workflow
1. **Morning**: Sprint planning and blocker identification
2. **Core Hours**: Feature implementation with pair programming
3. **Afternoon**: Code review and integration testing
4. **Evening**: Performance benchmarking and optimization

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Performance bottlenecks**: Continuous benchmarking
- **Platform compatibility**: Automated cross-platform testing
- **API stability**: Comprehensive test coverage

### Process Risks
- **Feature creep**: Strict prioritization and scope management
- **Quality degradation**: Automated quality gates
- **Team coordination**: Daily standups and clear ownership

## Success Metrics

### Weekly Targets
- **Commit frequency**: 20+ commits per day
- **Feature completion**: 95% of planned features
- **Bug resolution time**: < 24 hours
- **Test coverage**: > 90%

### Quality Gates
- All commits must pass automated tests
- Code review required for all changes
- Performance benchmarks must not regress
- Documentation must be updated with features
