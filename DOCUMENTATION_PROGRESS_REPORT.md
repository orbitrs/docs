   - Document best practices for organizing complex components

## Next Steps

1. Schedule a documentation review session with the team to validate the completed high-priority items
2. Begin addressing the medium-priority items based on the prioritization matrix
3. Review user feedback on existing documentation to identify any additional gaps
4. Consider implementing interactive examples or video tutorials for complex topics

## Conclusion

Significant progress has been made in addressing high-priority documentation gaps, particularly around API documentation, tooling, and core concepts. The focus will now shift to medium-priority items while continuing to improve and maintain the documentation that has been completed.

The documentation team should schedule regular reviews of the Content Gap Analysis document to ensure continued progress and alignment with the project's evolving needs.
