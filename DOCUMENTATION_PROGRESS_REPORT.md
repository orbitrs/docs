# Documentation Improvement Progress Report

## Overview

This report summarizes the progress made on the documentation improvement initiative for the Orbit UI Framework based on the Content Gap Analysis document. This update focuses on high-priority and medium-priority documentation tasks completed as of May 24, 2025.

## Development Priority Update

> **Important Notice (May 23, 2025)**: The team has decided to prioritize core framework development over SDK improvements. SDK-specific improvements are now considered non-essential as they are primarily used for personal development purposes. Documentation efforts should focus on core components (orbit, orbiton, orlint) rather than SDK enhancement features.
