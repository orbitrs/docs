## 20. ✅ WASM Build Configuration and Feature Separation (2024-01-XX)

**Priority**: High  
**Status**: Complete  

**Task Description:**
Fixed cargo workspace feature unification issues that were causing desktop dependencies to be included in WASM builds. Implemented proper target-specific dependency configuration to ensure clean separation between desktop and web builds.

**Completed:**
- ✅ Implemented target-specific dependencies in all workspace members
- ✅ Fixed feature unification conflicts by using `[target.'cfg(not(target_arch = "wasm32"))'.dependencies]` for desktop features
- ✅ Updated CI/CD pipeline to build specific packages for WASM rather than entire workspace
- ✅ Verified successful WASM builds for `orbit` and `examples` packages
- ✅ Confirmed desktop dependencies (glutin, skia-bindings) are excluded from WASM builds
- ✅ Updated deployment guide CI/CD examples

**Technical Changes:**
- Modified `examples/Cargo.toml`, `orbiton/Cargo.toml`, and `orlint/Cargo.toml` to use target-specific dependencies
- Updated `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to build `--package orbit` and `--package examples` for WASM
- Ensured CLI tools (`orbiton`, `orlint`) are only built for desktop platforms

**Impact:**
This resolves build failures and ensures Orbit Framework can be properly compiled for both desktop and web platforms without dependency conflicts.
